## Identifying Abnormalities in Blockchain Data using Graph-Based Visualization
_A Blockchain-Network-Portrait_

Blockchain technology has been used in cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, voting 
systems and DApps making it increasingly popular. This has benefits like decentralization, 
security and transparency for businesses and the public. But it has often been misused for money 
laundering, ransomware, fraud, and illegal transactions. The anonymity and decentralization of 
blockchain transactions make it difficult to track and identify the individuals involved in these 
activities. This has created opportunities for fraudsters and scammers to exploit the businesses and 
the people. These bad actors are damaging the reputation of blockchain technology, and they need 
to be traced. So, an effective method is needed for analysis of blockchain data to find possible 
fraud and detect suspicious activities.

The blockchain data is a distributed ledger which is transparent, but traceability is challenging with 
increasing number of transactions each year. There are approaches like clustering and statistical 
analysis done on the blockchain data to get valuable insight. A graph-based visualization can be 
another approach for analyzing and visualizing complex blockchain transactions. Social network 
analysis uses networks and graph theory to understand social structures and relationships among 
groups. A similar approach can be used on the analysis of the blockchain data. By representing the 
data as graph, it is possible to identify anomalous pattern in the data. This thesis proposes graphbased visualization and will demonstrate MVP for identifying the abnormalities in the blockchain 
data.

### Aims and objectives
* To develop graph-based visualization for identifying abnormalities in blockchain data.
* To identify anomalous patterns and suspicious nodes in the graph-based visualization.
* To create/demonstrate prototype for proposed method for abnormality detection.

### Rationale
In Feb 2022, US authorities arrested a couple accused of stealing bitcoin from the Bitfinex hack. 
They were accused of initiating 2000 unauthorized transactions that sent stolen bitcoin to their 
digital wallet. Bitcoin has been used for fraudulent activities and anomalies [1]. With increasing 
number of transactions on blockchain network, detecting fraudulent transaction and anomalies is 
becoming a challenge.

Going through the articles and literature reviews, graph-based visualization approach can be used 
for fraudulent transaction detection and anomaly detection in blockchain data. Interdependencies 
between different data objects (like sender, receiver and timestamp) can be used to analyze 
relations and connectivity patterns in networks to identify unusual patterns. Publicly available 
dataset for Ethereum blockchain data will be used for research and as a minimal viable product 
(MVP).

This thesis along with the MVP might be significant for organizations to identify and mitigate risks 
associated with fraudulent activities and anomalies in blockchain. This will help identify
patterns/behavior that will indicate fraud transaction or any potential risks.

Some of the research question that will be included are as follows:

* What anomalies can be observed in the network.
* How can graph analysis techniques be used to identify suspicious transaction patterns and anomalies on the blockchain data.
* How does accuracy and effectiveness of graph-based visualization techniques compare to traditional data analysis method for detecting anomalies in the blockchain data.

### Methodology
This thesis will be a research-based project with focus on developing an approach to identify 
abnormalities in blockchain data. The abnormalities may include fraud detection and anomaly 
detection. This will help find patterns that will aid in data-driven decisions and insight for 
regulators and law enforcement agencies.

The methodology consists of following steps:

**i. Data Acquisition:**

This step will consist of data extraction from the public API and pre-processing. The 
range(timeframe) of data will be latest 5 years or more. The fields will mainly include 
receiver, sender, hash, timestamp, etc. This step will also include data storage.

**ii. Data Analysis:**

This step will be research based. Development work will also be done to prepare it as 
a minimum viable product. This will include Connectivity Analysis, Centrality 
Analysis and Network analysis to identify potential anomalies and fraudulent activities.
Research will be needed for any other algorithm and approaches.

**iii. Research and Development:**

The research will be mainly around the data analysis step. Similarly, the development 
will be around the data acquisition step and creating the minimal viable product through 
the project/thesis
